# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the prices of houses based on their sizes using linear regression. It serves as a simple example of a data science project implemented in Python.

## Introduction

In this project, we utilize the principles of linear regression to predict house prices based on their sizes. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a machine learning model, make predictions, and evaluate model performance.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd house-price-prediction
```

3. Run the Python script:

```
python house_price_prediction.py
```

This will execute the script, which generates random data for house sizes and prices, trains a linear regression model, makes predictions, plots the results, and prints out the model's coefficients.
